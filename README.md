**This github-based fork of MONC is rapidly changing, with automated testing,
docs, etc being set up**

MONC is a highly scalable Large Eddy Simulation (LES) model that has been
developed to simulate clouds and turbulent flows at high resolution (~ 10s of
metres) on large domains. The MONC project was initially funded through a Joint
Weather and Climate Research Program (JWCRP) enabling post via NERC research
grant [NE/L01338X/1](http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/project/F1023ACF-76FF-4AD4-8E22-BA4A74451AD0),
which facilitated a collaboration between Met Office scientists and
computational scientists at [EPCC](http://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk/) to undertake the
development of MONC.

The main aim of the MONC project was to develop a high resolution atmospheric
process research model for the community that is user friendly and scalable on
modern high performance computing (HPC) systems. The scientific basis for MONC
is the Met Office Large Eddy Model (LEM) and the development involved the
complete re-write of the Met Office LEM using modern software design with
a flexible plug 'n play component based architecture with a focus on high
performance computing (HPC) scaling and efficiency.  '
